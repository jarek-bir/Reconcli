**Custom Profile System:**
Users can create custom boost profiles using YAML:

```yaml
# custom_profiles/healthcare.yaml
name: healthcare
description: "Medical and healthcare terminology"
base_words:
  - patient
  - doctor
  - medical
  - hospital
patterns:
  - "{word}med"
  - "med{word}"
  - "{word}_health"
multiplier: 2
```

**Plugin Architecture:**
```python
# plugins/custom_generator.py
class CustomWordGenerator:
    def generate(self, base_words, config):
        # Custom generation logic
        return generated_words
```
